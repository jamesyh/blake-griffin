Analyzing Blake Griffin's development as a player

Blake Griffin is an intriguing player. He has had to change his style of play because of injuries. When he first entered the league, he was very aggressive and would get to the hoop frequently for dunks and layups. Because of the injuries, he has stopped getting to the hoop as much and has relied more on shooting midrange and three point shots. Many people say that he has improved in his shooting ability and that he has become better shooter. 

I wanted to (1) see if his three point percentage has actually improved, and (2) if he has started taking/making more threes. I hypothesize that he hasn't become a better shooter but that he is talking more outside shots. 

To prove this hypothesis I scraped career box score data for Blake Griffin for his three pointers made and attempted. I then performed two seperate bayesian analyses. A binomial analysis of the misses and makes to see if the probability of making a three increases by year, and a poison analysis to see if the number of threes attempted/made increase by year.

The graphs show that for his 7th season the probability of him making a three point shot isn't different from his other seasons. However, the graphs clearly show that he took more three point shots per game in his 7th season and also made more. This shows that Blake Griffen hasn't improved his three point shooting ability but has started taking more three point shots per game.
